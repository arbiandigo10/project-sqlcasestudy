# Project: TokoPakdio Revenue Analysis for Bank BRI Transactions
## Description
This project analyzes transaction and payment data from the TokoPakdio app, focusing on revenue generated from successful transactions processed via Bank BRI. The project leverages ETL processes (Extract, Transform, Load) using DBeaver to cleanse and structure data for insights as part of a Business Intelligence analysis.

## Goals
- Extract relevant data from transaction and payment tables for analysis.
- Identify the product categories with the highest revenue.
- Compare revenue by payment method (Manual Transfer vs. Virtual Account) for successful transactions using Bank BRI.
  
## Insight Dependency
The analysis relies on:
- Transaction and payment data tables filtered for successful transactions.
- Product categories within TokoPakdio, including Electronics, Toys, Fashion, Sports, Food, Furniture, Gadget, and Home & Living.
- Payment method segmentation (Manual Transfer vs. Virtual Account) for revenue comparison.

## Insights
- Top Revenue Categories: Fashion ranks as the highest revenue-generating category, followed by Gadget and Home & Living.
- Payment Method Analysis: Manual Transfer transactions generated more revenue than Virtual Account transactions.

## Advice
- For Sales Strategy: Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue categories (Fashion, Gadget) to maximize returns.
- For Payment Method Optimization: Encourage the use of Manual Transfer, as it shows a higher revenue yield than Virtual Account for Bank BRI transactions.
